# Python Data Structures Tutorial

Welcome to my data structure tutorial. In here I will go over 3 different types of data structures:

* [Queues](queues.md)

* [Linked lists](linkedlist.md)

* [Binary Search Trees](BinarySearchTree.md)

Each tutorial will go over the basics of each data structure. There will be one example and two problem sets with solutions to do. You should only use the solution to compare your own solution
